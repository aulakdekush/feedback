In this repository you will find the official Codotto public feedback discussions.
This repository should be used to:

- report bugs to [codotto](https://github.com/CharlieBrownCharacter/feedback/issues/new/choose)
- request new features to [codotto](https://github.com/CharlieBrownCharacter/feedback/issues/new/choose)
- ask for help
- make any question that you think you need answers to

The discussions can be used to share their experience about a certain feature, how a certain feature should be improved or even suggest new features.

See our [making suggestions](https://github.com/CharlieBrownCharacter/feedback#making-suggestions) section on how to suggest a new feature.

# Making suggestions
We advise you to [open an issue](https://github.com/CharlieBrownCharacter/feedback/issues/new) with a label `enhancement` if you have a suggestion to a new feature or to improve our platform. We do not expect you to have a full solution to the problem you are facing to start a discussion. We expect to have a meaningful, productive and collaborative conversation whenever a new discussion is opened.

Before starting a new discussion, please check if we have already a discussion within the same topic. If you have found a new discussion in the same topic, upvote so that it gets better visibility from our team. Feel free to contribute to the discussion with your opinion on how the feature should work.

## From a suggestion [or request] to a finalized feature
As soon as a discussion is opened, our team will evaluate the feature and understand if the feature is something that will benefit the community in general. Therefore, it is extremely important that if you think a feature should be implemented, upvote it or participate in the discussion.

Our main criterias to a new feature are:
1. How many people is participating in the discussion?
2. Will this feature benefit the IT community or it will only benefit the individual asking for such feature?
3. How technically feasible it is to implement such feature

# Report a bug
We try our best to maintain a platform clear of bugs but as we all know this is close to impossible, therefore we encourage you to report any bug that you have found in our application to us.

You can [open a new issue](https://github.com/CharlieBrownCharacter/feedback/issues/new) with the label `bug` attached to it. Please, attach as much information about the bug as possible, as this will allow us to reproduce the bug faster and easier.
